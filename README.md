when selecting the "share song" option on spotify, the URL that is copied to the clipboard looks like this:  
https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/7a8Mt9TDUPMxdRtVvgEkjE?si=24748884221043e1  
the "intl-de" part of the URl is useless and this breaks the discord embedding when sharing this link on discord.  
this script can be run in the background and fixes a spotify url whenever one is copied, so that the embedding in discord works:  
https://open.spotify.com/track/7a8Mt9TDUPMxdRtVvgEkjE?si=24748884221043e1
